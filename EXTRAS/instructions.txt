To use XBMC over a reverse proxy you will need to replace and edit a couple of files in your computer. 

1. Enable the proper apache modules (In my case I used proxy_http and mod_proxy). The command is usually 'a2enmod MODULE'.
2. Allow URL rewriting/proxying in your apache file (in my case it was --> /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default) and add the following lines, adjusting them to match your configuration:

    ProxyPass /xbmc/ http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8080/ /xbmc/
    ProxyPass /xbmc/jsonrpc http://localhost:8080/jsonrpc
    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8080/jsonrpc /xbmc/jsonrpc

3. You will need to replace the XBMC WebServer files with the ones in this folder.

    On Ubuntu Linux the paths are the following:
      /usr/share/xbmc/addons/webinterface.default/js/Core.js
      /usr/share/xbmc/addons/webinterface.default/index.html 

Don't forget to check if the permissions are the same as before.

4. Restart your Apache service and you should be set.
    For Ubuntu the command is:
      service apache2 restart

Now XBMC's jsonrpc server should be accessible through http://localhost/xbmc/jsonrpc
